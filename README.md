2. My GitHub account is where I can store projects I have made. Additionally, it allows me to collaborate with others 

3. The repository I just created is where I can store all my work for this class. It allows me to safely make edits since I can make a new branch to test an edit and always come back to a previous version.  

4. In order to clone my repository to my local machine, I had to click the plus icon, click "clone a repository", and find my repository in the GitHub desktop application.
